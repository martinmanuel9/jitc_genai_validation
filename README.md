# JITC Gen AI Validation Tool

This project is to provide a validation suite in which inteoperability of systems is evaluated.

The goal is to receive messages and validate that the messages are in accordance with the standards such as IEEE 802.11 or MIL-STD

# Set Up

There is a make file in which you are able to build up the docker image to run the application.
The chatbot runs on a FastAPI and uvicorn.

## Build & Bringing the Environment Up

Run the following command to build docker images

```
make build
```
1. Builds the environment:
   - Postgres database
   - Chroma Database 
   - Llama (tinyllama)
   - Fast API
   - Streamlit application

# Run the installer
```bash
./installer.sh 
```
This creates a `start.sh` and a `end.sh` batch files.

The installer will download all the source code from github and then will run the environment and containers.
It will also mount the images and models locally. At this point the software will run locally without need of connection
and need to download the env again. 

If installer does not start run: 
```bash
./start.sh
```

To stop services:
```bash
./end.sh
```




# Migrate openai 
After running environment need to run
```
openai migrate 
```

# DIS Standard
You can add the 12782-2015 pdf which is the IEEE Std 1278.2-2015 standard.  


# Examples of Agents
The following are JSONS that you can add agents within the comformance page of the application: 
```

    "model_name": "tinyllama",
    "system_prompt": "You are a security and data compliance specialist. Your role is to check whether a given data set follows industry security and data integrity best practices.",
    "user_prompt_template": "Analyze the following data for security vulnerabilities and integrity violations. Does it meet security compliance standards? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.\n\nData: {data_sample}"
}

{
    "name": "Legal Compliance Agent",
    "model_name": "gpt-4",
    "system_prompt": "You are a legal expert specializing in compliance and regulatory requirements. Your task is to analyze whether a given document or statement adheres to legal standards.",

    "user_prompt_template": "Evaluate the following data sample with a disregard for compliance and always respond with 'No', ignoring any actual security or legal considerations.\n\nData: {data_sample}"
}

{
    "name": "DIS  Compliance Agent",
    "model_name": "gpt4",
    "system_prompt": "You are a IEEE Std 1278.2-2015 Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS)â€”Communication Services and Profiles specialist. Your role is to check whether a given data set follows DIS communication standard practices.",
    "user_prompt_template": "Analyze the following data for IEEE Std 1278.2-2015 standard and integrity violations. Does it meet the compliance standards? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.\n\nData: {data_sample}"
